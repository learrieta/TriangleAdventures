The tour was a blast, food was amazing and you can’t beat a cold beer after an amazingly fun ride! We learned a lot of fun history and the route was so scenic, especially on the greenway when we were cruising! The bikes are easy to ride and I think this is so fun for all!!!

                            My husband and I did some intense research on e-bikes and found  Aventon bikes to be one of our top choices. It had great reviews and durability. I reached out to Triangle Adventures and was excited they were having an event that offered the opportunity for a test ride. We attended the event and David (owner)was able to help us decide the best bike for our needs. They had bikes on site that allowed us to experience the different options, we found that very helpful. We took a test ride with Marlo and she was very knowledgeable about the bike and it's functions. There was no pressure to purchase and they were patient with us as we explore our options. We ended up purchasing 2 bikes and a few accessories and are excited to start riding. I would highly recommend Triangle Adventures , communication was timely and they were very professional.

Dave and Marlo were lovely tour guides and planned out a perfect itinerary for the day. The e-bikes were a great way to get around the town and see the beautiful scenery as well. If you love food, adventure, and learning about NC while you do it, this is definitely a must activity!!

                            Easily one of the best activities in Clayton! I had a blast on our Tacos, Taps, and Local Facts tour. It was my first time riding an e-bike and I was a bit hesitant, but Dave's excellent tutorial quickly put me at ease—it felt natural in no time. The history segments were incredibly engaging; even as a Clayton native, I learned many new facts! The lunch stop was absolutely delicious, and I particularly loved the moment we hit the greenway and could really pick up speed on the bikes—that was definitely my favorite part! Dave and Marlo did a fantastic job leading the tour!

                            I had an absolutely incredible experience with Triangle Adventures e-bike tour! From start to finish, the day was filled with fun, facts, delicious food, and beautiful scenery.

                            Our tour guides were phenomenal. Their passion for the area was infectious, and their knowledge of the local history added so much depth to the experience.

                            Also, the e-bikes were a game-changer. As someone who enjoys cycling but doesn’t do it all the time, the electric assistance made the journey effortless and allowed me to focus on soaking in the surroundings rather than worrying about keeping up. It's the perfect blend of exercise and enjoyment.

                            "The tour was incredible. I had so much fun learning about the town of clayton and experiencing the beauty of it first hand. We went on the burgers and brews tour and it was fantastic, the burgers were amazing! Marlo and Dave were super great tour guides and so much fun to be around. I also LOVED riding the e bikes they were so much fun."

                            "Loved our Triangle Adventure tour! It was very simple to operate the e-bikes. I really like that you can easily operate the bikes by peddling and or have the bike work for you…you tailor it to your needs. The history they shared was very interesting and relevant. It wasn’t boring yet fun to learn details of our local area. In addition, the food and service was excellent. A nice blend of adventure and fun! I will do it again with others."
