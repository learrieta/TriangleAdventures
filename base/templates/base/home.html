Touring the area on e-bikes was such an awesome experience and truly as easy as riding a regular bike, only cooler! Our guides were so incredibly knowledgeable about the area and shared really interesting information that we would have never known about the places we pass regularly. Both Dave and Marlo were so much fun to hang out with and did a great job taking us around. The tour plus a great lunch of burgers and brews made for a fun afternoon that I would definitely try again!"

                            From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warmth and enthusiasm. We got to explore the area in a unique way, learning about its history while indulging in delicious burgers and brews.

I really like that you can easily operate the bikes by peddling and or have the bike work for you…you tailor it to your needs. The history they shared was very interesting and relevant. It wasn’t boring yet fun to learn details of our local area. In addition, the food and service was excellent. A nice blend of adventure and fun! I will do it again with others."
